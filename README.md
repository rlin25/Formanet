> Data visualization is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data and information. It is also the study of visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition, including both numerical and non-numerical data.

Formanet is a front-end project presentation of my adventures wih photography and conceptualization. It provides insights into the ways I visualize the world around me. The interactive visuals used in the project makes it an effective tool for connecting concepts.

## Diagram Types

Visualizations are organized by chart type. So far these have been added.

The project is constantly expanding. Charts are added as I learn new concepts.
