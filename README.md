> Data and information visualization (data viz or info viz) is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data and information. It is a particularly efficient way of communicating when the data or information is numerous as for example a time series.

Formanet is a front-end presentation of my adventures wih photography and conceptualization. It provides insights into the ways I visualize the world around me. The interactive visuals used in the project makes it an effective tool for connecting concepts.

## Diagram Types

Visualizations are organized by chart type. So far these have been added.

| Title | Subtitle | Visualization |
| --- | --- | --- |
|[Explore Reality](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/11930261/)|Photo Map|Photo Marker Map|
|[Discover Wonder](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/11917558/)|Concept Net|Network Graph|
|[Advance Skill](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/11919306/)|Character Sheet|Radar Chart|

The project is constantly expanding. Charts are added as I learn new concepts.
